Goal: Create a program that displays the available tiles in the tilemap and
allows the user to place those tiles. The user can then export the map to a
CSV file.

(From the course)
In your application, the user should be able to:
   *Click and select a tile from the tile texture
   *Use the mouse to draw/paint the map with the selected tile
   *Select an option to save the .map file with a list of tile numbers that
   were used to create the map
